Prompt
Write a function that accepts an array of strings. Return the longest string.


Approach
What is our Input?
String[] = an array of strings

What is our Output?
String = the longest of the strings in the array

Questions to ask the interviewer:
Do we need to consider if there are no strings in the array?

For this challenge, no
Do we need to consider times when all of the strings are the same length?

Yes. Return the first string.

Longest String Plan
For this problem, we need to:

Initialize and Declare Variable for Longest String
Loop through the array
Find the length of each string
Determine if that length is the largest we have seen so far.
Replace the longest/largest variable with the arr[index] as long as length is greater than the variable.
Return longest/largest string.
